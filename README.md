<!-- # React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  extends: [
    // Remove ...tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
    ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
    // Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
    ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
    // Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
    ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,
  ],
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import reactX from 'eslint-plugin-react-x'
import reactDom from 'eslint-plugin-react-dom'

export default tseslint.config({
  plugins: {
    // Add the react-x and react-dom plugins
    'react-x': reactX,
    'react-dom': reactDom,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended typescript rules
    ...reactX.configs['recommended-typescript'].rules,
    ...reactDom.configs.recommended.rules,
  },
})
```

# Slack Chat App Clone

This project is a Slack-like chat application built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Redux Toolkit**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Vite**. It provides a real-time chat experience with features like conversation switching and responsive design.

## Application Structure and Decisions

````

### Key Decisions

- **React with TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Simplifies state management with slices and thunks.
- **TailwindCSS**: Provides a utility-first approach for styling, ensuring a consistent and responsive design.
- **Vite**: Chosen for its fast build times and modern development experience.

---

## State Management Explanation

The application uses **Redux Toolkit** for state management. The state is divided into two main slices:

1. **Auth Slice**: Manages user authentication state, including the logged-in user's details.
2. **Chat Slice**: Handles chat-related state, including:
   - `activeConversation`: The currently selected conversation.
   - `messages`: Messages for the active conversation.

### Example: Chat State Usage

The `ChatPage` component uses the `useSelector` hook to access the `activeConversation` and `messages` from the Redux store:

```tsx
const { activeConversation, messages } = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.chat);
````

Actions like `selectConversation` and `loadMessages` are dispatched using the `useChat` custom hook, which abstracts Redux logic for better reusability.

## Tradeoffs and Assumptions Made

### Tradeoffs

1. **Mock API with JSON Server**:

   - **Tradeoff**: Limited to local development and lacks real-time updates.
   - **Benefit**: Simplifies development and testing without requiring a backend.

2. **No WebSocket Support**:

   - **Tradeoff**: Real-time updates are simulated by reloading messages.
   - **Benefit**: Reduces complexity for the initial implementation.

3. **Simple Authentication**:
   - **Tradeoff**: Authentication is mocked, and no secure backend is implemented.
   - **Benefit**: Focuses on chat functionality without backend dependencies.

### Assumptions

- Users are pre-defined in the mock API (`/users` endpoint).
- Conversations and messages are static and fetched from the mock API.
- The application is used in a single-tab environment.

---

## Features

- **Authentication**: Login functionality with Redux state management.
- **Conversations**: View and switch between different chat conversations.
- **Real-time Messaging**: Send and view messages in real-time.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with TailwindCSS for a modern and responsive UI.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add WebSocket support for real-time updates.
- Implement user registration and profile management.
- Add support for file sharing in chats.
- Improve error handling and loading states.
